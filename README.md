# NEAproject_mazesolver
A-Level NEA project

This repo contains the final python files uplaoded and graded.

Main python libaries used:
1. Numpy
2. Tkinter
3. Pillow

TO USE:
1. run main_menu.py This should open a main menu for you to choose between a generator and solver
2. Generator generates square mazes at any size needed, just enter the width and height required in the boxes before generating
3. Solver requires a maze either
  1. generated by the included generator with or without bitmap
  2. OR black and white in a normal picture format (jpeg, png etc.)
4. use the tickboxes to change the mode, visualized mode is very slow, I am too lazy to change the rendering method now
5. if using bitmap, import the one generated by the maze genereator as well, this makes maze solving quicker (unsupported for other mazes)
6. if prompted, enter the coordinates of the start and end location of the maze
7. watch the progran (hopefully) solves your maze.

Updates
- I am unlikely to ever update this program, do not ask me for support.
